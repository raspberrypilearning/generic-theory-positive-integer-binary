Binary or base 2 is a number system which only uses the digits 0 and 1. We usually use denary which uses the digits 0 to 9.

Here is the number 5 in binary.

The top line of numbers represent the **place value** of each digit, rather like you may have written H T U to represent hundreds, tens and units when you were very young. Notice that these place values double as they move to the left.

To work out the equivalent number in denary, add the place values containing a 1 together. In this case we are adding 4 + 1 = 5

Each place is called a **bit** and this number is represented with 8 bits. The largest positive integer we can represent using this notation is 255 which would be 11111111 in binary. To represent larger numbers, we need more bits!
